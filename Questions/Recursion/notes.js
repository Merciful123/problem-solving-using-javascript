// to solve a recursion problem always keep in mind the example of dragon and little boy problem, given by colt steel sir

//  Dragon said to little boy i can tell you about only the first number

//  little boy was genious and he made this the base case of the problem

//  and used this option to solve his problem recursively( using recursion)


//  so that's why we have a recursive function here.
