* Sorting:-> It is a way of sorting items in a collection so that items are in some sort of order.


** Bubble sort pseudocode

--> start looping from with a variable called (i) the end of the array towards the beginning.
--> start an inner loop with a variable called (j) from the beginning untill  (i-1)
--> if array[j] is greater than array[j+1] swap those two values
--> return the sorted array
