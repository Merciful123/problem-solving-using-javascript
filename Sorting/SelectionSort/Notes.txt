--> Store the first element as the smallest value you've seen so far.

--> Compare this item to the next item in the array until you find a smaller number.

--> If a smaller number is found, designate that smaller number to be the new "minimum" and
    continue until the end of the array.

--> If the "minimum" is not the value (index) you initially began with, swap the two values.

--> Repeat this with the next element until the array is sorted.
